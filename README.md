  ## Description
    Developers frequently have to create interfaces that 
    allow non-developers to easily view and interact with 
    information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS).

    It's your job to build the back end, connect the two, 
    and then deploy the entire application to Heroku.

  ## Installation
  1. Clone the Github repo.
  2. Install dependencies using "npm install"

  3. Now you are ready to begin Employee Tracker using the command node start
